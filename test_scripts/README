This directory contains a little script that works with RVM and
bundler to allow you to easily run the Hobo unit tests under a variety
of versions of Ruby and Rails.

It's pretty simple.  There are a number of `Gemfile`'s under
test_scripts/gemsets/GEMSET/RAILS_VERSION/Gemfile where GEMSET is a
the name of a Ruby with the hobotest gemset in an RVM compatible form
(ie. ruby-1.8.7-p249@hobotest) and RAILS_VERSION descibes which rails
the Gemfile includes (ie rails-2.3.11).

You'll have to install all the rubies and the gems for each bundle
before you can run the script.

Step 1:   install the rubies.  For example:

    rvm install ruby-1.8.7-p249
    rvm use ruby-1.8.7-p249

I suggest just installing a single ruby to start and then removing all
of the other directories until you have things working.  You can
always get them back by checking them out from git.

Step 2:   create the gemsets.

    rvm gemset use hobotest --create

Step 3:  populate the gemsets

for each RAILS_VERSION:

    cd RAILS_VERSION
    bundle install

Step 4:  run the test script:

    test_scripts/test_all_gemsets.sh

If it runs successfully, it will print "TESTS SUCCESSFUL."  If it
fails, it will stop at the failure point.
