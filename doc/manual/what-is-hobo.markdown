What is Hobo?
{.document-title}

Hobo is a collection of open-source gems/plugins for Ruby on Rails
that help you build anything from throwaway prototypes and internal
utilities to meticulously crafted full-blown web apps. The goal: write
less code. So much less in fact that it starts to feel like you're not
implementing your app at all, you're just declaring what you want.

It turns out that the hard part is not going fast, but staying
flexible. This is where we think Hobo really shines. If you've played
with "app builders" before, you'll know about The Wall. The Wall is
the point you reach where you have to give up and do it the old way
because that one feature you really need just isn't going to
happen. Hobo doesn't have one.
